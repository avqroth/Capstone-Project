Hello, I am Avery and here is my Capstone-Project aka Log Flex! 
My app is a workout logger that saves the data using User Defaults. For the network call, I used an Exercise API that displays the muscle group and even the difficulty level of the exercise. 
For the errors on empty data, please click on adductors and expert for it to pop up. For the List, head over to SearchExercisesView. I used a system image and the name of the exercise and as you tap on a particular exercise it will take you to its details! I stored the API Key in a plist and put it into the .gitignore. I do not have a low request limit on my API. On the network calls, I am open to any better ways to call it. Any suggestions/criticsm is welcome! This is an app I would like to works towards publishing on the app store. Also the app does store the data, youll have to refresh the app for it to show in the workout history. Unfortunately i wasn't able get around to improving that.
